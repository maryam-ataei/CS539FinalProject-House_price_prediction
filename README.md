# House_price_prediction

This repository contains the Predict Rental Prices project. This project utilizes Melbourne Airbnb open data to predict the rental price
of a short-stay house using machine learning techniques such as data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation. 
Several regression models are applied, including linear regression, Support Vector Machines, decision tree, random forest and Multi Layer 
Perception and these models are evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Cross Validation Mean Squared Error (CV). 

The repository is as follows:

'Process_notbook.ipynb` contains the overview of the project.

`data.rar` file contains the dataset that it is not cleaned.

'Method.ipynb` is a file that contains the data preprocessing, feature selection, model impelementation, and evaluation.
